# Javascript Tarot Thrower

This is a simple page that allows one to throw a tarot spread on line. It is written many years ago with jQuery.

It currently only provide the Celtic Cross spread with the Smith/Waite Tarot deck. The interpretations on the cards were edited together 
from a number of sources in book and online. I did not keep track of those sources.
